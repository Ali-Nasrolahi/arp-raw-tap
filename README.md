# Tinkering with Ethernet: An ARP Responder with TAP & OVS

A lightweight C program that demonstrates ARP packet crafting using a Linux TAP device.  
Please refer to the post on my website at [Tinkering with Ethernet](https://ali-nasrolahi.github.io/posts/tinker-with-eth-arp-tap-and-ovs/)
for further details.

Mentioned commands in the post are gathered in a simple `Makefile`.  
Feel free to experiment!  Happy tinkering!
